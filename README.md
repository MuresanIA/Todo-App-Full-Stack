Hello,

Thank you for your interest in my Todo - Application.

This is repository contains the source code for the Front - End of the application.

Here you can find the source code for the Back - End of the application: 

https://github.com/MuresanIA/Todo-App-Full-Stack-Restful-Web-Services

The steps in creating the application:

1. I have connected Angular Front - End to Spring - Boot restful services.

2. I have implemented basic authentication with Spring - Boot and Spring - Security.

3. I have connected Spring - Security and Spring - Boot with JWT - Framework.

4. I have connected Spring - Boot restful API with JPA and Hibernate.


Each of these steps is visible through my pushes to  main  branch .
